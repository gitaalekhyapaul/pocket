### 💡 Core Functionality

#### 1. Family Setup

1. Parent connects wallet and creates a family account
2. Deploys FamilyAccount contract with parent as owner
3. Adds family members (children/guardians) with spending limits
4. Configures approval requirements per member

#### 2. Delegated Spending

1. Child attempts to spend tokens via `spendAsDelegate()`
2. System checks daily limit and approval requirements
3. If approval needed: Creates pending request
4. Parent receives real-time notification
5. Parent can approve/reject with reason
6. If approved: Transaction executes on-chain

#### 3. Real-time Monitoring

- Backend listens to blockchain events
- Updates database with new transactions/requests
- Frontend receives live updates via WebSocket
- Complete audit trail of all activities

### 🚀 Deployment & Demo

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository>
