# MetaMask Smart Accounts & Delegation starter template

This is a NextJS MetaMask Smart Accounts & Delegation starter template created with `@metamask/create-gator-app`.

This template is meant to help you bootstrap your own projects with Metamask Smart Acounts. It helps you build smart accounts with account abstraction, and powerful delegation features.

## Prerequisites

1. **Pimlico API Key**: In this template, you’ll use Pimlico’s 
bundler and paymaster services to submit user operations and 
sponsor transactions. You can get your API key from [Pimlico’s dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys).

2. **Web3Auth Client ID**: During setup, if you used the 
`-add-web3auth` flag, you’ll need to create a new project on the 
Web3Auth Dashboard and get your Client ID. You can follow the [Web3Auth documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/dashboard-setup#getting-started).
